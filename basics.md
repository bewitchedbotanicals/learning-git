# Git Basics

* git init - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* git status - I can use this anytime to see the curent status of the repository
* git add - Places one or more files in the staging area
* git commit - Commits changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository) 
* git diff - Displays the different versions in document
* git log - Shows the history of what you have added and committed
